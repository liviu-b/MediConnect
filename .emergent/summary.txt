1. I noticed a bug: Once I am logged in as a user or clinic administrator and I click on the logo on the top left, it automatically takes me to the start page, that is, it logs me out. Correct this so it doesn't happen again.
2. In Patiend dashboard, make some changes in UI, because i saw many white spaces. Make that Dashboard a bit more practical, intuitive, with more options
3. In Patient page, when i go to Menu (left) Add Settings for Patient above Sign Out
4. in the Patient page, when going to the Menu (left) when the patient user clicks on Medical Centers, to be able to open the tab of each medical center, description, details.
5. Create records for each past appointment, eventually with details about patient, issues, treatment, etc.
6. In Patient Calendar, make appoiment more visibile in calendar. Also, in Calendar section when i change in RO, calendar still remain in EN, fix this.
7. I saw when i try to register as new patient, its a bug somewhere because when i press Sign Up, it tells me An occured error but the user is already added in db, and 2nd time when i press Sign Up it work. FIX IT. 

7. In Register as Medical Center, it is a bug when i introduce CUI although it is correct, it tells me that CUI must contain 2-10 digits only. I think its a bug and please fix this!
8. In Register as Medical Center also in Already Registered, when i press Back button, it take me in Sign in page for patient. I want to fix this. When i press Back just to send me in Start Page
9. Once an administrator is loged in Dashbord of medical center, i saw some bugs about language switch. For example when i add a doctor, if i change in RO, those medical specialties remain in EN. Fix.
